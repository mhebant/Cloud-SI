One of my first website: a really basic (and insecure) “cloud” I use with friends for a project in high school (2013) to store and share the files and be able to track the progression of the project.

It features: 
* A login system
* A chat room (using AJAX)
* File download/upload/update (keep track of all the versions of the files)
* A message section to log the activity
